I didn't know if I'd ever write on a website again. Since 2016 I stopped writing and as a blogger, I was offline due to lack of time among other personal problems. Today, thanks to the fact that I got back my [GitHub user](https://github.com/lourcastillo) and supported with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/community/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I will try to bring something "new" to the web.

<div align="center"> 
        
<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/firefox_community/7305063022/in/faves-36529808@N06/" title="IMG_1855"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7239/7305063022_a13660420b_n.jpg" width="213" height="320" alt="IMG_1855"></a>

</div>

Rather than being a test post, it is a statement about the issues I will address here. The influence will come strongly on Quality Assurance, Testing Strategy, methodologies, automation, serverless, among other things, and keeping the focus on free software and Open Source.

The whole page is in beta phase and constant development, so I will be testing things that might not work (please understand).

See you soon!
